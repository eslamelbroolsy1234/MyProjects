- **Client Management:**
  - Add new clients.
  - Delete clients.
  - Update client information.
  - Find clients by account number.
  - Display a list of all clients.

- **File Handling:**
  - Clients' data is stored in a file (`Clients.txt`).
  - The program can load and save client data to the file.

- **Basic Structure:**
  - The program uses a simple menu-driven interface.
  - No transaction management or user permissions are included.

### **2. Second Project: Bank2_Transactions**
This version introduces **transaction management** and enhances the system with the following features:

- **Transaction Management:**
  - **Deposit:** Users can deposit money into a client's account.
  - **Withdraw:** Users can withdraw money from a client's account, with checks for sufficient balance.
  - **Total Balances:** Users can view the total balance of all clients in the system.

- **Improved Client Management:**
  - The program ensures that accounts exist before performing transactions.
  - Data validation is added to prevent errors (e.g., invalid account numbers or insufficient balance).

- **File Handling:**
  - Transactions are saved to the `Clients.txt` file, ensuring data persistence.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**

  - The `CheckAccessPermission` function ensures users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

- **Enhanced Transaction Management:**
  - Transactions are now tied to user permissions.
  - Only users with the appropriate permissions can perform deposits, withdrawals, or view total balances.

- **File Handling:**
  - Users' data is stored in a separate file (`Users.txt`).
  - The program can load and save user data to the file.

- **Login System:**
  - Users must log in with a username and password to access the system.
