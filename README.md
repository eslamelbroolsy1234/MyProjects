This Repo are containing all projects in Abo_Hadhood Course

#[1] The first project about Bank : 
This C++ program is a basic Bank Management System that allows managing client accounts. It supports adding, updating, deleting, and searching for clients using a text file as storage. The data is stored in a structured format, and users can interact via a menu-driven interface. The program ensures data integrity by checking for duplicate accounts before adding new clients. It provides a simple and efficient way to handle basic banking operations.

#[2] The Second project about Bank2_Transactions : 
This version is not very different from the initial project, but we have added the following enhancements. This section of the C++ program handles deposit and withdrawal transactions for client accounts. It allows users to deposit or withdraw money while ensuring the account exists and has sufficient balance for withdrawals. The program confirms transactions before processing them and updates the account balance accordingly. It also saves the updated data to a file to maintain records. Additionally, users can view the total balance of all clients in the system. The menu-driven approach makes transactions easy and user-friendly. This is an enhancement of the initial project, adding transaction management features.
